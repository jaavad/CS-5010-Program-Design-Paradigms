# CS-5010-Program-Design-Paradigms Overview

In CS 5010, I embarked on a journey into the realms of object-oriented programming and design, gaining valuable insights into problem-solving approaches and developing robust solutions through program design paradigms. We explored both object-oriented and functional design paradigms, with a primary focus on object-oriented program design and the creation of abstractions that facilitate reusable software and libraries.

**Course Highlights:**

- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- Comparison of Object-Oriented and Functional Programming paradigms.
- Deep dive into fundamental object-oriented concepts, including:
  - Information hiding
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism
- Emphasis on techniques like inheritance and composition for software reuse.
- Exploration of graphical notations like UML for object-oriented design.
- Comprehensive study of commonly used design patterns.
- Particular emphasis on testing, especially unit testing with the JUnit framework.

**Key Concepts and Topics Covered:**

- Sequential Structures and Abstract Data Types in Java
- Hierarchical Structures
- Scaling up program designs through model-view-controller and model-builder-controller approaches
- Utilization of key design patterns such as Adapter, Facade, Command, Iterator, and Visitor.
- In-depth exploration of Strategy and Decorator Design Patterns.

**Areas of Expertise Gained:**

- Decorators and Iterators: Understanding and application of these design patterns.
- Interface Segregation: Principles of designing clean and efficient interfaces.
- Mocks and Command Design Pattern: Application of command patterns in various contexts.
- Builder: Practical use of the builder pattern, as exemplified by a "Burrito" case.
- List Operations: Operations and manipulation of lists in Java.
- Abstraction: The significance of abstracting concepts and elements.
- Testing and Documentation: Comprehensive testing methodologies, with a focus on JUnit Testing.
